## 🚀 How to Contribute
1. **Fork the repository**   
- Go to the project’s GitHub page and click **Fork**.
  
- This creates your own copy of the repo under your account.
- 2. **Clone your fork**    

   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>

3. Create a new branch

4. Make your changes

Keep commits atomic (small and clear).

Follow consistent code style and naming conventions.

5. Push to your fork

git push origin feature/your-feature-name

6. Submit a Pull Request

Open a PR against the main branch of the original repo.

Include a clear title and description of what your change does and why it’s needed.


# ✅ Code Review Process

All changes must go through a Pull Request (PR) and review before merging:

Each PR must be reviewed by at least one maintainer.

No one (except maintainers) can push directly to main.

PRs with breaking changes or new features must include documentation updates.


# 🧩 Coding Guidelines

Use meaningful commit messages (feat: add login component, fix: resolve null pointer error).

Maintain readable, well-commented code.

Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

Test before submitting.

We are committed to maintaining a respectful and inclusive community.
Be kind, be constructive, and help others grow.
